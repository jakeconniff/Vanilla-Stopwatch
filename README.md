# Vanilla-Stopwatch
My first personal project repo! Beginning to explore JavaScript outside of class and truly get comfortable. With this project, I'm refamiliarizing myself with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

This project is fairly simplistic, consisting of:
-Time field
-Start timer button
-Stop timer button
-Reset timer button

The functionality of the timer is complete, I just want to make it look nicer in color scheme, shapes, fonts, spatial interaction, etc.
